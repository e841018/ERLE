# ERLE
This is an accelerated version of the ERLE compression function in [pycrafter6500](https://github.com/csi-dcsc/Pycrafter6500/blob/master/pycrafter6500.py). The purpose of the compression is to accelerate the upload speed to the DMD evaluation board [DLPLCR6500EVM](https://www.ti.com/store/ti/en/p/product/?p=DLPLCR6500EVM).

The compressed format conforms to the descriptions in http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/dlpu018.

The upload speed is slightly faster than the reference software given by TI, which is written in C++.
